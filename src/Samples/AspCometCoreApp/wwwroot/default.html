    <h2>Welcome to the .NET Core 'Chat' Web App</h2>

    <pre>
    This is a direct steal of code from the older &quot;Chat-vs2010&quot; web application.
    The older application relies on the DLL generated from the "AspComet-vs2010" library.
    This application relies on the DLL generated from the "AspCoreCometware" library.
</pre>
    <p>
        The comet URL in the older app was /comet, whereas this app uses /comet/45.0,<br />
        as my goal was to mimick a SalesForce server (aka "org")
    </p>
    <p>
        To change the comet path, look at the way the UseCometMiddleware is referenced in Startup.cs.<br />
        You may need to update the javascript source for the below client UIs, too.
    </p>
    <h3>Comet Terminal</h3>
    <a href="CometdTerminal.html" target="terminal">Go to the Comet Terminal</a>

    <h3>Dojo</h3>
    <p>You can see when others join the 'chat' channel - launch multiple Dojo clients (multiple browser windows)</p>
    <a href="Dojo.html" target="_blank">Go to the Dojo to start a chat session.</a>
